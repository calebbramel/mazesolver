# mazesolver

This is a fun program that randomly generates a maze and uses depth first search to evaluate routes and determine if it's solveable.

The search will start at the upper-left entrance and immediately return true if it reaches the bottom-right exit.

You can visually track the red "current" route and gray "failed" routes.
